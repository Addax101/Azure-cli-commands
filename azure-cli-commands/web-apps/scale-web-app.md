## Scale a web app in Azure using the CLI
To scale a web app in Azure using the CLI, follow these steps:

* Open a command prompt or terminal window and run the following command to scale up your web app to a larger pricing tier:
`az appservice plan update \
--name myPlan \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--sku S2` 

Replace `myPlan` with the name of the app service plan where your web app is located, `myResourceGroup` with the name of the resource group where your app service plan is located, and `S2` with the SKU of the pricing tier you want to scale up to. You can also scale down your web app by specifying a smaller SKU.

* Run the following command to update your web app to use the new pricing tier: `az webapp update \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name myWebApp \
--plan myPlan`

Replace `myResourceGroup` with the name of the resource group where your web app is located, `myWebApp` with the name of your web app, and `myPlan` with the name of the app service plan you updated in step 1.

* Wait for the scaling operation to complete. You can use the following command to check the status of the app service plan:
`az appservice plan show --name myPlan --resource-group myResourceGroup --query sku.name`

This command should return the name of the SKU for the app service plan.

Congratulations! You have now scaled your web app in Azure using the CLI.
